# Lords OF Legend Game Development Notes


## 1. Fix Combo Counter

- **Details**: The combo counter needs to be adjusted to accurately reflect the player's successful hits in sequence.
- **Current Issues**: The counter isn't resetting correctly after a missed shot, and sometimes it doesnâ€™t increment on consecutive hits.
- **Action Items**: Review the logic for combo detection, ensure it resets properly on miss, and increments correctly on hits.


## 2. Make the Power-Ups

- **Details**: Implement various power-ups to enhance gameplay.
- **Types Needed**:
  - **Shield Boost**: Temporarily grants invincibility.
  - **Rapid Fire**: Increases laser firing speed.
  - **Speed Boost**: Temporarily increases the player's ship speed.
- **Action Items**: Design power-up sprites, implement power-up logic, and integrate with existing gameplay mechanics.


## 3. Fix the Images to Be Moving

- **Details**: Ensure all images, particularly enemy sprites, have smooth and continuous movement animations.
- **Current Issues**: Some images appear static or have jittery movements.
- **Action Items**: Refactor the animation code, ensure proper frame updates, and check for performance issues that may affect smooth movement.


## 4. Fix the Speed of Enemies

- **Details**: Adjust the speed at which enemies approach the player to ensure balanced difficulty.
- **Current Issues**: Some enemies move too slowly, making the game less challenging, while others are too fast, making them difficult to defeat.
- **Action Items**: Set appropriate speed parameters for each enemy type and test the gameplay balance.


## 5. Make the Enemies the Same Width

- **Details**: Standardize the width of all enemy sprites to ensure consistent hit detection and visual appeal.
- **Current Issues**: Some enemies are disproportionately wide, affecting gameplay and collision detection.
- **Action Items**: Resize and standardize enemy sprites, adjust hitboxes accordingly, and test for any gameplay impacts.
